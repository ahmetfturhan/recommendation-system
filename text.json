  "text": "John, a resident of New York, works for Microsoft as a software engineer. He started working there on January 1, 2021 and makes $100,000 per year. He usually works from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, but sometimes puts in extra hours if he has a deadline to meet. John's boss, Mary, told him that he has done an excellent job and is eligible for a 50% raise. He is thrilled and can't wait to tell his wife, who is also a software engineer at the United Nations. He will give her a call at 555-555-5555 to share the good news.",
